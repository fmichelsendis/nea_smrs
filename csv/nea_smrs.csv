Nuclear Innovation 2050 and related activities;"The Nuclear Innovation 2050 (NI2050) is a NEA-wide initiative aimed at boosting innovation in the nuclear sector, accelerating the development and reducing time to market for innovative technologies through innovative processes, involving all necessary stakeholders. It was launched in 2015 covering a wide scope of technology areas, addressing reactor systems design and operation, fuels and fuel cycle technologies, used fuel management and decommissioning, and applications beyond electricity generation. NI2050 is not the framework where the innovation per se would happen, but it proposes priority topics with an innovation potential, instilling the dynamics of innovation among relevant stakeholders, helping them to collaborate on projects and work together to find the necessary means for their implementation.
At this point, there are several ongoing initiatives in NEA in the area of innovation that were convened under the auspices of NI2050, and there is a need for an Innovation Advisory Panel (IAP) to coordinate all these activities and drive the appropriate focus. This new Innovation Advisory Panel would be composed of experts from the nuclear industry (utilities, suppliers, etc.), nuclear regulatory organization, technology organizations, the financial sector, non-nuclear industry representatives and social science experts.

The front-end and back-end nuclear fuel cycle for SMRs;"SMRs may require adjustments or new developments for the fuel cycle. Some SMR vendors have proposed the utilization of High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium in their designs. HALEU has enrichment levels between 5% and 19%. The impact of using HALEU in the global nuclear fuel supply chain and in the entire fuel cycle may need to be further assessed. Similarly, for countries pursuing a closed nuclear fuel cycle, the ability to use MOX fuel may also be an important attribute for some SMR designs. Other advanced fuels proposed for various SMR concepts may also pose challenges both from the supply chain and fuel manufacturing point of view, and from the long term management of used fuel and radioactive waste.

Due to the possibility of factory production, the economics and the potential increasing returns of scale of the front-end of SMR construction is of considerable interest. ";TBC;TBC;NTE;NDC;Approved;Specific;; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ;;;;;;;; TRUE ;; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;;;;

The Expert Group would provide advice on the scope of work, provide expert input, and validate analysis. It should be composed by 10-15 experts able to contribute to discussions and analyses of the three sectorial case studies.

Financing for electricity systems;The construction of new nuclear power plants is a complex industrial undertaking that can result in significant financial risks in a number of dimensions. Specifically, the challenge lies in the capital-intensive nature of nuclear energy projects and the multi-decadal project lifetimes over which costs are recovered. These lifetimes are often deemed too long by traditional private sources of capital to be acceptable without a robust allocation of construction and market risks. Environmental-Social-Governance (ESG) Criteria, or sustainable financing criteria are increasingly used by investors to assess the environmental and societal impact of a potential investment. Nuclear energy, as a proven source of low carbon electricity is well placed to play a role here. This activity will build upon the learnings of the NEA “Workshop on Innovative Financing: Towards Sustainable Nuclear Financing”, which will take place in January 2021 and is a carry-over due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ;Workshop and study report;TBC;NTE;NDC;Approved;Relevant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;
Role of nuclear in sector coupling (heat, hydrogen, mobility, desalination);"The role of nuclear energy for the production of low carbon electricity is well known and normally considered in most decarbonisation scenarios. The reality is that nuclear energy is one of the few non-emitting energy sources capable of providing heat in addition to electricity but the potential role of nuclear heat is often ignored in most decarbonisation scenarios, including most of the scenarios reviewed by IPCC. This is an important opportunity lost because this low carbon heat offers great promise to decarbonise hard to abate sectors such as the heat production and the industrial sectors. The study would look at (1) electricity production in the presence of large shares of electric vehicles (how would this affect the load curve? Would this benefit or penalize nuclear?); (2) hydrogen production from either variable renewables or nuclear power, taking into account detailed data on ramping ability of electrolysers and (3) CHP and district heating. In addition, the study would evaluate the potential impact to the nuclear business case when both electricity and heat are marketable products.";Study report;TBC;NTE;NDC;Approved;Relevant; TRUE ; TRUE ;;;; TRUE ; TRUE ;; TRUE ; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ;; TRUE

Market design for electricity systems;There is an intrinsic link between financing and the design of electricity markets. Current electricity markets do not have signals or provide price stability to encourage investment in capital intensive low carbon technologies. These low carbon technologies will require specific financing solutions as they will not be deployed solely on the basis of marginal cost pricing in competitive, deregulated electricity markets. Policymakers have to strike the appropriate balance between out-of market support and exposure to wholesale market prices for low-carbon technologies with high fixed costs such as nuclear and VRE. In addition, the role of electricity market reforms to support long-term price signals should not be neglected. Long-term CO2 price trajectories can especially complement innovative financing arrangements to reduce the expected gap with the wholesale electricity price and strengthen the market framework.;TBC;TBC;NTE;NDC;Approved;Relevant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;
Efficient contractual arrangements for nuclear projects;Nuclear projects have faced contracting challenges that have contributed significantly to cost overruns and project delays. This is true for nuclear new build projects, but also for the back end of the fuel cycle (in particular decommissioning).  Some of the key issues include: (i) allocation of risks within contracts and transaction costs, (ii) level of completeness of project designs and execution plans, (iii) ability to face unexpected situations. This study would draw lessons learnt from recent projects, in particular good practices from other industries and successful nuclear projects. Finally, an important issue relates to the ability to develop long term contractual frameworks to incentivize the supply chain in a way that is compatible with competition laws (an important issue in the EU context for the countries looking at a fleet program).  ;TBC;TBC;NTE;NDC;Approved;Relevant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; TRUE ;;; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;

Similarly, for countries pursuing a closed nuclear fuel cycle, the ability to use MOX fuel may also be an important attribute for some SMR designs. Other advanced fuels proposed for various SMR concepts may also pose challenges both from the supply chain and fuel manufacturing point of view, and from the long term management of used fuel and radioactive waste.

Due to the possibility of factory production, the economics and the potential increasing returns of scale of the front-end of SMR construction is of considerable interest. ";TBC;TBC;NTE;NDC;Planned;Specific;; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ; TRUE ;;;;;;;;; TRUE ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SMR sectoral studies;"Each case study will apply a standard framework to review SMRs value proposition and decision drivers
Coal replacement
Industrial heat applications and extractive industries
Off-diesel in remote regions 

Creation of an NDC/SMR Expert Group
SMR is an area where the NDC programme of work would benefit greatly from an Expert Group to frame activities and engage directly with sectoral experts
The Expert Group would provide advice on the scope of work, provide expert input, and validate analysis. It should be composed by 10-15 experts able to contribute to discussions and analyses of the three sectorial case studies. In order to maintain neutrality, the SMR-EG should not include direct participation by SMR vendors.

Nuclear Innovation 2050 and related activities;"The Nuclear Innovation 2050 (NI2050) is a NEA-wide initiative aimed at boosting innovation in the nuclear sector, accelerating the development and reducing time to market for innovative technologies through innovative processes, involving all necessary stakeholders. It was launched in 2015 covering a wide scope of technology areas, addressing reactor systems design and operation, fuels and fuel cycle technologies, used fuel management and decommissioning, and applications beyond electricity generation. NI2050 is not the framework where the innovation per se would happen, but it proposes priority topics with an innovation potential, instilling the dynamics of innovation among relevant stakeholders, helping them to collaborate on projects and work together to find the necessary means for their implementation.
At this point, there are several ongoing initiatives in NEA in the area of innovation that were convened under the auspices of NI2050, and there is a need for an Innovation Advisory Panel (IAP) to coordinate all these activities and drive the appropriate focus. This new Innovation Advisory Panel would be composed of experts from the nuclear industry (utilities, suppliers, etc.), nuclear regulatory organization, technology organizations, the financial sector, non-nuclear industry representatives and social science experts.

Financial Support for Nuclear from multinational and national financial institutes;"Joint NEA/IFNEC project

There are two phases to engage with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on nuclear financing: 

Develop an initial inventory of institutions to consider for engagement
Generate data on the institutions : current areas of activities and priorities, adopted policy in the field of energy projects, decision making mechanism and structures/individuals to be approached
Prioritise the institutions according to well-defined criteria

Develop and implement engagement plans based on the gathered information 
 Engagement meetings, webinars, country engagements, interactions with other multinational organizations
